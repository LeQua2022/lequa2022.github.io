## LeQua 2022: Data

- The data on which the tested systems will be required to operate will consist of product reviews from the Amazon website. 
- In tasks 1a and 1c the label of each review will be a sentiment-based polarity ("Positive" or "Negative", with "Positive" standing for all reviews marked 4 stars or higher and "Negative" standing for all reviews marked 2 stars or lower), while in Tasks 1b and 1d the label of each review will be the merchandise class (“Arts&Crafts”, “Automotive”, “Baby”, ...) to which the product belongs. In all the above cases, the predictor will thus be asked to predict *how many* among the reviews in the test sample are about a given merchandise class, and to do this for all classes in the set.
