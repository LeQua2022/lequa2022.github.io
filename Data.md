## Data

- The data on which the tested systems will be required to operate will consist of product reviews from the Amazon website. 
- In Tasks 1A and 2A the label of each review will be a sentiment-based polarity ("Positive" or "Negative", with "Positive" standing for all reviews marked 4 stars or higher and "Negative" standing for all reviews marked 2 stars or lower), while in Tasks 1B and 2B the label of each review will be the merchandise class (“Automotive”, “Baby”, "Beauty", ...) to which the product belongs. In all the above cases, the predictor will thus be asked to predict *how many* among the reviews in the test sample are about a given merchandise class, and to do this for all classes in the set.
