LeQua 2022 will offer two tasks (T1 and T2), each admitting two subtasks (A and B):

- **Task T1A**: This task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that must only predict the relative frequencies of a class and its complement. Participants in this task will be provided with documents already converted into vector form; the task is thus suitable for participants who do not wish to engage in generating  representations for the textual documents, but want instead to concentrate on optimizing the methods for learning to quantify.
- **Task T1B**: This task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on documents that each belong to exactly one among a set of n>2 classes. Like in Task T1A, participants will be provided with documents already converted in vector form.
- **Task T2A**: Like Task T1A, this task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers. Unlike in Task T1A, participants will be provided with the raw text of documents; the task is thus suitable for participants who also wish to engage in generating suitable representations for the textual documents, or to train end-to-end systems.
- **Task T2B**: Like Task T1B, this task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers; like in Task T2A, participants will be provided with the raw text of  documents.
