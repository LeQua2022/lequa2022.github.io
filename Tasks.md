LeQua 2022 will offer four tasks:

- **Task 1a**: This task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that must only predict the relative frequencies of a class and its complement. Participants in this task will be provided with training and test documents already converted into vector form; the task is thus suitable for participants who do not wish to engage in generating suitable representations for the textual documents, but want instead to concentrate on optimizing the methods for learning to quantify.
- **Task 1b**: This task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on documents that each belong to exactly one among a set of n>2 classes. Like in Task 1a, participants will be provided with training and test documents already converted in vector form.
- **Task 2a**: Like Task 1a, this task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers. Unlike in Task 1a, participants will be provided with the raw text of both training and test documents; the task is thus suitable for participants who also wish to engage in generating suitable representations for the textual documents, or to train end-to-end systems.
- **Task 2b**: Like Task 1b, this task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers; like in Task 2a, participants will be provided with the raw text of both training and test documents.
