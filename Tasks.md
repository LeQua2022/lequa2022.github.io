LeQua 2022 will offer two tasks (T1 and T2), each admitting two subtasks (A and B):

- **Task T1A**: This task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that must only predict the relative frequencies of a class and its complement. Participants in this task will be provided with documents already converted into vector form; the task is thus suitable for participants who do not wish to engage in generating  representations for the textual documents, but want instead to concentrate on optimizing the methods for learning to quantify.
- **Task T1B**: This task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on documents that each belong to exactly one among a set of n>2 classes. Like in Task T1A, participants will be provided with documents already converted in vector form.
- **Task T2A**: Like Task T1A, this task is concerned with evaluating binary quantifiers. Unlike in Task T1A, participants will be provided with the raw text of the documents; the task is thus suitable for participants who also wish to engage in generating suitable representations for the textual documents, or to train end-to-end systems.
- **Task T2B**: Like Task T1B, this task is concerned with evaluating single-label multi-class quantifiers; like in Task T2A, participants will be provided with the raw text of the documents.

**For each subtask in {T1A,T1B,T2A,T2B}, participant teams are not supposed to use (training / development / test) documents other than those provided for that subtask.** In particular, participants are not supposed to use any document from either T2A or T2B in order to solve either T1A or T1B.

Register you and your team for participating in LeQua 2022 (and other CLEF 2022 labs too) on the [CLEF 2022 Lab registration page](https://clef2022-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/); you can decide to participate in all four LeQua 2002 tasks or only in the ones you are most interested in.
